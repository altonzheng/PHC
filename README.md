# Project Homeless Connect Flagship

React + Express powered client management system for PHC SF.

## What is PHC?

Project Homeless Connect excels in connecting the most vulnerable San Franciscans to vital resources throughout the city. At our one-stop shop events and in our office every day, we link participants to difficult-to-obtain services including medical, dental and vision care, and employment assistance. By mobilizing city and community agencies, as well as thousands of volunteers, we are able to ensure that our participants receive holistic care in a dignified setting.​
